\section{If the patient is not smoking and has not recently visited Asia, can you infer with disease?}
No, it is not possible to infer the disease with 100\% certainty. The disease with the highest probability is Bronchitis.\\
$P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, T) = P(T|\bar{A},\bar{S}) * P(\bar{A}|\bar{S}) * P(\bar{S}) = 0.01 * 0.9 * 0.7 = 6.3\%$\\
$P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, C) = P(C|\bar{A},\bar{S}) * P(\bar{A}|\bar{S}) * P(\bar{S}) = 0.02* 0.9 * 0.7 = 12.6\%$\\
$P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, B) \geq P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, B, \bar{T}, \bar{C}) = P(B,\bar{T}, \bar{C} |\bar{A},\bar{S}) * P(\bar{A}|\bar{S}) * P(\bar{S}) = 0.8 * 0.9 * 0.7 = 50.4\%$\\
\section{According to the disease inferred in Point 2, the doctor decides to auscultate the patient's lungs with a stethoscope? Why?}
In order to decide whether the person has a Bronchitis this test is helpful. If the person has a bronchitis, than it is highly likely that he will not have cancer and tuberculosis.\\
\section*{The stethoscope test is negative. What is the new inferred diagnosis?}
The disease with the highest likelihood is now tuberculosis.\\
$ P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, C, \bar{ST}) = P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, C) * P(C | \bar{ST}) = 12.6\% * 1\% = 0.126\% $\\
$ P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, B, \bar{ST}) = P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, B) * P(C | \bar{ST}) = 50.4\% * 1\% = 0.504\% $\\
$P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, T, \bar{ST}) = P(\bar{A}, \bar{S}, T) = 6.3\%$
\section{The doctor orders an X-Ray. The X-Ray test is positive. What is the new inferred diagnosis?}
Tuberculosis\\

\section{Was the X-Ray needed?}
The X-Ray increased the certainty.
